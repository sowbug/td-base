Tower Defense

I wrote this as a starting point for tower-defense-style games. It's a complete
game in the sense that it has scoring, start conditions, end conditions, and
strategy, but it's not a very good game for the following reasons:

  - gameplay isn't balanced. The buy/sell values are arbitrary, and the
    enemy/turret strengths haven't been adjusted.
  - The turrets are not accurate shooters. This is very frustrating to watch
    because the player can't really do anything about it.
  - There aren't enough different turret/enemy types. So the game becomes
    tedious after a while.

Additionally, the cosmetics and UI could always be improved.
